We motivate the use of Rejection and the Alias method due to the large search and time and/or bookkeeping. 

Some way of making the crude method more effective is:
 - Rearranging the probabilities so we have the largest probability first
 - Using more advanced search methods such as binary search.



In the continues case. What we do is that we say

U = F(X)

So given a distribution F, we try to find how X should be distributed in order to get a uniform distribution.
In this formula we can then solve for X to find out how to should do our sampling.

X = F^{-1}(U)
